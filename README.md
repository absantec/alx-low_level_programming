0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
Define a new type struct dog with the following elements:

name, type = char *
age, type = float
owner, type = char *

1. A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself
2. A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad
